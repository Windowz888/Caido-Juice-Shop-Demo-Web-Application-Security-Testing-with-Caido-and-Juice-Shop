# Caido-Juice-Shop-Demo-Web-Application-Security-Testing-with-Caido-and-Juice-Shop
Demonstrated web application security testing by integrating Caido proxy with OWASP Juice Shop. Showcased attack detection and vulnerability workflows (cookies, authentication, HTTP history analysis) as part of a BootCon presentation. Delivered slides, scripts, and live demo walkthrough, highlighting web app security testing methodologies.
# Caido + Juice Shop (BootCon Presentation)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was presented at BootCon, a mock cybersecurity conference. It demonstrates how to use **Caido**, a modern web application security testing tool, in combination with **OWASP Juice Shop** (deliberately vulnerable web app) for hands-on vulnerability testing.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- Caido (Web security testing proxy)
- OWASP Juice Shop (ginandjuice.shop online lab)
- FoxyProxy (traffic routing)
- macOS / Kali Linux testing environments

## 🔑 Key Demonstrations
1. **Proxy Setup** – Routed browser traffic through Caido.  
2. **Traffic Analysis** – Captured HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses.  
3. **Scopes & Sitemap** – Filtered targets and visualized application endpoints.  
4. **Workflow Automation** – Highlighted requests with cookies automatically.  
5. **Replay & Automation** – Replayed login POST requests, tested brute force with wordlists.  

## 📷 Proof of Concept
- Screenshots of Caido HTTP history and workflows.  
- Live/recorded demo showing vulnerability analysis.  
- Slide deck in `/presentation/`.  

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
- Web application vulnerability testing  
- Proxy traffic interception & automation  
- Presentation & technical communication (BootCon conference style)
